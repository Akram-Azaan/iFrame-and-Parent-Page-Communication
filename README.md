# iFrame and Parent Page Communication
Welcome to the *"iFrame and Parent Page Communication"* repository. This project showcases how to create messengers and listeners between an iframe and the website where the iframe is embedded.

## Files:
1.  index.html: This file facilitates two-way communication between the parent site and the iframe.
2.  recive.html: In this file, the iframe can only listen to messages from the parent site.
3.  send.html: Here, the iframe can only send messages to the parent site.
4.  iframeboth.html: This file contains the iframe used in index.html.
5.  iframe_that_recives.html: This file contains the iframe used in recive.html.
6.  iframe_that_sends.html: This file contains the iframe used in send.html.

## Additional Resources:
When running the project, you will find two links to javascript.info, which provide documentation on cross-window communication.
We hope this repository helps you understand and implement effective communication techniques between iframes and their parent pages. Feel free to explore and experiment with the provided files.

Happy coding!
